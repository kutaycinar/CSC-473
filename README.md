# CSC-473

Completed coursework for [CSC 473: Introduction to Computer Graphics (Spring 2021)](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2021091/CSC473 "UVic Course Page") at University of Victoria.

### Topics

CSC473 presents topics in computer animation starting with traditional computer-based methods and working through fundamental algorithms including, but not limited to, interpolation schemes, integration, physically-based animation, and practical implementations. Time permitting, advanced topics in computer animation will be introduced, such as physical phenomena and machine learning in animation. Detailed topics list provided below.

- Principles of traditional animation
- Motion
- Interpolation
- Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations
- Particle systems
- Orientation, Quaternion interpolation
- Dynamics
- Forward kinematics
- Inverse kinematics
- Lagrangian mechanics
- Rigid body dynamics
- Articulated character animation
- Behavioural animation
- Introductions to advanced animation techniques (soft bodies, physical phenomonen: fluids/fire/smoke, learning motion)
